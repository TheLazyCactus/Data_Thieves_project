# The Guardians of the Voiceless

## Project Overview: Connecting Shelter Dogs with Communities

**The Guardians of the Voiceless** is an initiative dedicated to connecting shelter dogs with local community centers, such as retirement homes, schools, and other organizations. This project aims to promote mental health, companionship, and emotional well-being through meaningful interactions between animals and people.

By leveraging **Petfinder's real-time animal data** and the **Google Maps API**, this service ensures seamless matches between shelter animals and community needs.

## üöÄ Description of the Project

This project creates a service that facilitates:

- **Visits by shelter dogs to community locations**, benefiting both the animals and individuals.
- **Group visits to shelters** (e.g., school visits), raising awareness of shelter dogs, increasing adoption rates, and generating financial support.

### üóÇÔ∏è Pipeline: Data Integration

1. **Petfinder Web Scraping:**  
   - Extracts detailed information about shelter dogs in Los Angeles, including availability, personality traits, photos, and proximity to identified community centers.

2. **Google Maps API:**  
   - Locates potential community partners (retirement homes, schools, and similar organizations).
   - Provides details like names, addresses, contact information, and facility types.

By integrating these two data sources, the project creates tailored matches that align the needs of shelters and the community.
